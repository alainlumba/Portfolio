                        I am a fresh graduate from our lady of fatima university. I chose this field of study because
                        I've been always interested in technology and how life makes easier. Specially when I challenge
                        myself to learn more
                        about what is web development.
                        <br><br>
                        I like doing some graphic designs and editing some animations but,
                        <br><br>
                        Currently, Im studying hard about being a front end developer.
                        I feel that i can manage this position where i can effectively show my skills.
                        <br><br>
